### Basic idea
* In MI x MI, the main goal is to destroy all of the bubbles.
* The player shoots a bubble from a fixed area of the screen.
* Aiming and shooting are controlled via the mouse.
* In each game, bubbles have one of a fixed number of colors.
* A group of bubbles bursts when collided with a fired bubble of the same color.
* When a fired bubble collides with an opposite color, the bubbles on the screen multiply.
* Fired bubbles bounce off the screen edges.
* Obstacles make it harder to aim.

### Next steps
* Create a user-friendly UI.
* Introduce a level system.
* Improve graphics.
* Add animations.
* Make the color blind mode.
* Introduce more advanced game mechanics.
