# mi X mi
*Simple bubble game project made with Python and Pygame.*
*Inspired by my mom's favorite game - Clusterz.*

### Current stage of development
Planning phase. Nothing to see here (yet), but a man with a plan.

### Basic idea
* In mi X mi, the main goal is to destroy all of the bubbles.
* The player shoots a bubble from a fixed place on the screen.
* Aiming and shooting are controlled via the mouse.
* In each game, bubbles have one of a fixed number of colors.
* A group of bubbles bursts when collided with a fired bubble of the same color.
* When a fired bubble collides with an opposite color, the bubbles on the screen multiply.
* Fired bubbles bounce off the screen edges.
* Obstacles make it harder to aim.

### Next steps
* Create a user-friendly UI.
* Introduce a level system.
* Add limited bubbles with special powers.
